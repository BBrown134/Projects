# Projects
Hello!  
This section is for completed projects that I have done either professionally or casually in my spare time.  
Current projects in this section are:  
-NCTC Project Presentation is a PDF regarding whether or not terrorist groups use the arts and antiquities market as a avenue to fund their operations.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This was a capstone project for UNO's Business Analytics and Data Analytics MBA programs, all work was done  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without assistance from an instructor and outside of classtime.  
-Himalayan Dashboard is Power BI dashboard showing key metrics and statistics of individual mountain expeditions in the Himalayan mountain range.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This was a personal project I completed as I was interested in having an interface that could be used to compare  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different summits and visualize key metrics for those interested in planning their own expedition.
