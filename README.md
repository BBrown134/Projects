# Projects
Hello!
This section is for completed projects that I have done either professionally or casually in my spare time. 
Current projects in this section are:
  -NCTC PDF presentation regarding whether or not terrorist groups use the arts and antiquities market as a avenue to fund their operations
  -Himalayan Power BI dashboard showing key metrics and statistics of individual mountain expeditions in the Himalayan mountain range.
